In this project we will be creating a cloud development kit using AWS and golang, before we start we will need a couple of things to handle this project. Here are the project pre-requisite:

1. AWS account and IAM user
2. AWS CLI
3. IDE with golang extensions installed.
4. Node.js- The aws CDK makes use of node js
5. AWS-CDK tool kit.
6. Golang.

Steps:
1. Log in to your console and create an IAM user with the name "AWS-CDK"
2. Create an access key for your AWS-CDK user.
3. The next step is to choose our terminal and workspace. For this project  i will be using the AWS cloud9 because it has the aws-cli, go, aws-cdk and node installed on it already. Definitely the best choice
   for this project.
